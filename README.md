# üè† Local dotfiles

This repository contains computer specific configuration to accompany my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aronnebrivio/dotfiles).

Once cloned, switch to desired branch and run `./install` to automatically set up the development environment.
*Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.*

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.
