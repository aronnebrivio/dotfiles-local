# 🏠 Local dotfiles

This repository contains computer specific configuration to accompany my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aronnebrivio/dotfiles).

Once cloned, run `./install` to automatically set up the development environment.
*Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.*

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

# Branch hierarchy
Configurations for specific PCs/OSs are maintained in
separate branches:

```
master
|
+- company-mbp
+- abo
```

**NOTE:** *"Abo"* stands for *"Abominio Traballante"* (= wobbly abomination). It's my beloved personal XPS-13 currently running [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) ❤️
